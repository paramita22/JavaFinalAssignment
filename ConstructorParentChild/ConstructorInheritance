Rules of creating a Constructor:
1. Contructors are methods with the same name as the class
2. Constructors do not have any return type, not even void
3. Constructors are default, non-parametrised, and parametrised
4. If no constructor is declared by the user, it is created by the jvm at runtime, known as default constructors which are non-parametrised in nature
5. Once a non-parametrised constructoer is created, jvm does not create any default constructor






The program on Parent-Child class::

1> Output : When method display() is in parent class

I am the Parent
integer=10, float= 23.4 , String= Home
I am the Child
integer=30, float= 4.4 , String= Child call
Variables of the parent class are: Integer= 10, Float= 23.4, String= Home

2> Output : When method display() is in child class it overrides the display() method in parent at runtime

I am the Parent
integer=10, float= 23.4 , String= Home
I am the Child
integer=30, float= 4.4 , String= Child call
Variables of the child class are: Integer= 30, Float= 4.4, String= Child call
